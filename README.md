Hello,

This is a portfolio of my work. I have done a lot of work in PHP, Drupal, Javascript, CSS, and HTML over the years. This is a small sample of work I have done or a place to put projects that previous employers have allowed to lapse into a non-functioning state. 

For additional examples of my work you can take a look at:
